Super Simple CMS
==============

The idea behind this CMS is that you just plug it in and its ready to go.  It isn't meant to be a full on CMS that you might use to power big end sites, but rather to deal with brochureware on sites that you are building a more extensive application for.  

This plugin is on github and I'm encouraging everyone and anyone to please modify it, make it better than I can!

git:
https://github.com/neshmi/super_simple_cms/tree/master

rubyforge:
http://supersimplecms.rubyforge.org

Example
=======

The basis of the plugin is really that you shouldn't need to do anything to your app to make it work other than a few lines here and there.  You need to generate the migration to create the table for the CMS:

ruby script/generate super_simple_cms

Once that is done, run your migrations and start up your server and browse to:

localhost:3000/admin/super_simple

Add a couple pages, or groups and you should be set and ready to go!

Enjoy the simplicity!
